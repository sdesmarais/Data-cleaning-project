# Data-cleaning-project - Steve Desmarais
This repo contains two primary files:

1) Code Book - Describes the study and variables produced

2) Readme.md - R code and steps used to take the raw data to the final analysis set.  Documentation is integrated into the final code as contained below.

 Code to create tidy data

 READ DATA FOR TEST GROUP

 The raw data contains 561 variables with column names contained in features.txt.  This file
 is necessary to apply column names to the data file.  In opening the file, it was noted that
 only 477 of 561 feature names are unique (84 duplicate names).  R noted the issue but 
 there were no data errors so the warnings were ignored. Columns are named "row" and
 "varname".

library(readr)
features <- read_delim("C:/Users/desma/Google Drive/Coursera/Data Cleaning/Project/UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt", 
                            " ", escape_double = FALSE, col_names = c("row", "varname"), 
                            trim_ws = TRUE)

 Raw data were provided in text (txt) files. For the large data files, these were converted
 into Excel xlsx format for simpler conversion and reading into R Studio.  Other import  
 functions read the data as character rather than number.

library(readxl)
X_test <- read_excel("C:/Users/desma/Google Drive/Coursera/Data Cleaning/Project/UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.xlsx", 
                          col_names = FALSE)

 Assign column names from the features file. Remove "()" in every name to simplify column names

features$newname <- gsub("[()]","",features$varname)
colnames(X_test) <- features$newname

 REDUCE FILE TO COLUMNS RELATED TO EITHER MEAN OR STANDARD DEVIATION (STD) MEASURES
 Used grep function to identify columns with the word "mean" and store in rel_mean vector.

rel_mean <- grep("mean", features$varname)

 Used grep function to identify columns with the word "std" (standard deviation) and 
 store in rel_std vector
rel_std <- grep("std", features$varname)

 Combine rel_mean and rel_std into single rel_both vector and sort by column number.
rel_both <- append(rel_mean, rel_std)
rel_both <- sort(rel_both)

 Use rel_both file to subset the relevant columns of X_test into new file X_test_reduced

X_test_reduced <- X_test[,rel_both]

 APPEND COLUMNS TO IDENTIFY SUBJECT ID (1-30) AND ACTIVITY (LAY, WALK UPSTAIRS, ETC.)

 Raw data did not contain subject ID (subject_test.txt) and activty (y_test.txt) for each 
 row of data.  These are provided in separate files. Both have the correct number of rows
 to match data in X_test data file. For ease of processing, the files were converted in Excel to comma separated (csv)
 prior to reading into R. In addition, column names were added as the first row and the files
 were renamed to subject_id.csv and y_test_id.csv prior to importing.

subject_id <- read_csv("C:/Users/desma/Google Drive/Coursera/Data Cleaning/Project/UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_id.csv")
y_test_id <- read_csv("C:/Users/desma/Google Drive/Coursera/Data Cleaning/Project/UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test_id.csv")

 Combine subject and test ID information into a new file, subject_test. Then add group
 designation as "test".

subject_test <- cbind.data.frame(subject_id, y_test_id)
subject_test$group <- "test"

 Read activity_labels file, which contains spelled out activity names, and merge with the 
 subject_test file.

activity_labels <- read_delim("C:/Users/desma/Google Drive/Coursera/Data Cleaning/Project/UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt", 
                                  " ", escape_double = FALSE, col_names = c("test", "label"), 
                                  trim_ws = TRUE)

 Merge activity labels for ease of viewing data rather than only the numeric test ID.

subject_test2 <- merge.data.frame(subject_test, activity_labels, by.x = "test", by.y = "test")

 Create final dataset for the test group by combining subject and test information 
 (subject_test2) with the X_test_reduced data file that contains the 79 relevant variables.

x_test_complete <- cbind.data.frame(subject_test2, X_test_reduced)

 Repeat process for Train group

 READ DATA FOR TRAIN GROUP

 FEATURES FILE EXISTS FROM PRIOR PROCESS

 Raw data were provided in text (txt) files. For the large data files, these were converted
 into Excel xlsx format for simpler conversion and reading into R Studio.  Other import  
 functions read the data as character rather than number.

X_train <- read_excel("C:/Users/desma/Google Drive/Coursera/Data Cleaning/Project/UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.xlsx", 
                     col_names = FALSE)

 Assign column names from the features file. Remove "()" in every name to simplify column names

features$newname <- gsub("[()]","",features$varname)
colnames(X_train) <- features$newname

 REDUCE FILE TO COLUMNS RELATED TO EITHER MEAN OR STANDARD DEVIATION (STD) MEASURES
 Used grep function to identify columns with the word "mean" and store in rel_mean vector.

 USE REL_BOTH FILE CREATED FOR X_TEST GROUP
 Use rel_both file to subset the relevant columns of X_test into new file X_test_reduced

X_train_reduced <- X_train[,rel_both]

 APPEND COLUMNS TO IDENTIFY SUBJECT ID (1-30) AND ACTIVITY (LAY, WALK UPSTAIRS, ETC.)

 Raw data did not contain subject ID (subject_train.txt) and activty (y_train.txt) for each 
 row of data.  These are provided in separate files. Both have the correct number of rows
 to match data in X_train data file. For ease of processing, the files were converted in Excel to comma separated (csv)
 prior to reading into R. In addition, column names were added as the first row and the files
 were renamed to subject_id.csv and y_test_id.csv prior to importing.

subject_train_id <- read_csv("C:/Users/desma/Google Drive/Coursera/Data Cleaning/Project/UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train_id.csv")
y_train_id <- read_csv("C:/Users/desma/Google Drive/Coursera/Data Cleaning/Project/UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train_id.csv")

 Combine subject and test ID information into a new file, subject_test.

subject_train <- cbind.data.frame(subject_train_id, y_train_id)
subject_train$group <- "train"

 Read activity_labels file, which contains spelled out activity names, and merge with the 
 subject_test file.  USE FILE FROM PROCESSING OF TEST GROUP


 Merge activity labels for ease of viewing data rather than only the numeric test ID.

subject_train2 <- merge.data.frame(subject_train, activity_labels, by.x = "test", by.y = "test")

 Create final dataset for the test group by combining subject and test information 
 (subject_test2) with the X_test_reduced data file that contains the 79 relevant variables.

X_train_complete <- cbind.data.frame(subject_train2, X_train_reduced)

######################################################################################

 Combine train and test data into single file - X_data_all

#####################################################################################

X_data_all <- rbind.data.frame(X_train_complete,X_test_complete)

#####################################################################################

 Create a summary file of results by subject and test (walking, sitting, etc.)

######################################################################################

library(dplyr)
X_data_groups <- group_by(X_data_all, subject, test) 
X_data_means <- summarize_each(X_data_groups, funs(mean))

 Produced tidy data with 180 observations of mean value for 79 measurement variables for 
 30 subjects times 6 activities.
