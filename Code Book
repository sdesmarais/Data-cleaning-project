Experimental study design
-------------------------
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. Subjects were randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers (21 subjects) was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data (9 subjects). 

Though not clearly stated in the documentation, it appears that the objective of the study is to identify accellerometer and gyroscope measures that can reliably differentiate among the six activities.

------------------------
Definitions of variables
------------------------
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

Raw data is composed of the following:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.

Each measure captured 128 observations within each defined time period.  In this analysis, the raw data was not used.

In addition, a 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The data provide a rich set of summary measures to analyze the relevant measures.

------------------
Variables excluded
------------------
Per instructions, this analysis created a dataset with only measures of mean and standard deviation (std).  This seems reasonable because mean is the most common measure of central tendency and standard deviation represents dispersion.  In normally distributed groups, the mean and median are equal, i.e., 50% of the population is above and 50% are below the mean.  Similarly, standard deviation then tells us that 68% of observations lie within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% are within two standard deviations and 99.5% (virtually all) are within three standard deviations.

--------------
Variable Names
--------------
Names of variables were reviewed and found to be reasonably descriptive since each described the measure as either time (t) or FFT (f).  However, it was bothersome that variable names also contained "()" because parentheses normally are used only to set off parameters.  Therefore, the parentheses were removed from all file names.

------------------
Final Summary Data
------------------
The last step in processing the data was to create a summary file of mean values by subject and activity/test.  This produced 180 rows (6 activities X 30 subjects) as a simple file for analysis.
